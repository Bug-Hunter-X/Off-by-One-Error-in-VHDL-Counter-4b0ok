This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, off-by-one error in VHDL code. The `buggy_counter.vhd` file contains a counter that exhibits incorrect behavior due to an erroneous comparison in the if statement within its process. The `fixed_counter.vhd` file provides the corrected code which addresses the off-by-one error and ensures the counter functions as expected.  The bug is present in the comparison used to determine when the counter should reset. This simple example highlights how easily such errors can occur in digital design and emphasizes the importance of careful code review and testing.
